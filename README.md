# Basketball-Interactions-with-a-rim
With each basketball player comes a unique shooting technique. Understanding how a basketball interacts with a rim and backboard can be beneficial to shooters who would like to enhance their foul shot percentages and rebounding. We studied how the coefficient of restitution affects the direction of the bounce of a 29.5-inch regulation basketball after a collision with a stationary rim and backboard. This research was conducted in the fall of 2016. 

## Motivation 

Basketball is my favorite sport. While attending High Point University, I played pick up games everyday at 5 PM in the gymnasium. The competition was fierce so I wanted to have more insight that would assist me in staying on the court for longer periods of time. If I were able to make more shots, it would translate to scoring more points and ultimately ensure my team did not lose to our opponent. With this in mind, I turned to the physics of a basketball shot to determine what would increase my odds of making each shot that i took. 

## Coding Style 

All coding was completed in Python. Additional coding was done in Latex in order to create a formal paper summarizing my research over the semester. 

## Tracker Program

The program Tracker was used to analyze the videos for each shot.

## Credits 

I would like to note that this research would not have been possible without my partner, Spencer Ader, as well as our research mentor, Dr. Aaron Titus.
